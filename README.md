# Endr
An **En**gine for **D**OM **R**endering.

# Why?
Endr takes the best parts of React and ditches the rest to result in a lean and
fast virtual DOM rendering library. React is a great tool but has acquired some
baggage over its long career that it must maintain for backwards compatibility.
Endr loses the baggage and keeps the modern API.
